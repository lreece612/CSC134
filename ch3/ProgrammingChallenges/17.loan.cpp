// Programming Challenge 3.17 - Monthly Payments
//
// The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the following formula:
//
//            Rate * (1 + Rate)^N
// Payment = --------------------- * L
//             ((1 + Rate)^N - 1)
//
// Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided
// by 12. (12% annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.) N is the
// number of payments and L is the amount of the loan. Write a program that asks
// for these values and displays a report similar to:
//
// Loan Amount:            $ 10000.00
// Monthly Interest Rate:          1%
// Number of Payments:             36
// Monthly Payment:        $   332.14
// Amount Paid Back:       $ 11957.15
// Interest Paid:          $  1957.15
//
